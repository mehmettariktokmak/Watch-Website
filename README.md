Watch Website

In this website, which I built using **HTML and CSS**, I wanted to showcase my frontend skills.  
On the homepage, you can see photos of the most popular watches, and when you hover over them with the cursor, additional information about the watches is displayed.  

This site can be used as a store advertisement page or as a sales page.  

## Features
- Responsive design with HTML & CSS  
- Popular watch gallery  
- Hover effect to show watch details
- 
- [View the Website](https://mehmettariktokmak.github.io/Watch-Website/)
